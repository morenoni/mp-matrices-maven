Overview:

This project creates a two-dimensional matrix ADT using a generic array of arrays (`T[][]`), following the assignmentâ€™s approach. The matrix supports key operations such as getting and setting elements, inserting and deleting rows and columns, and filling regions or lines with values. The array-of-arrays structure was chosen for its clarity in handling individual rows and columns, and exceptions are used to prevent invalid operations.
